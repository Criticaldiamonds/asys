#Asys

Asys is a convenient, multi-purpose, Rich Text editor with support for multiple types of text formatting.  What other editors fall short in, Asys makes up for with a convient interface, tabbed documents, and several preferences for enhancing the user experience.

##Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

###Prerequisites

Asys requires the .NET Framework 4.5 be installed on your system.
 - If you are installing for development or testing purposes, you may need to install the framework manually.
 - If you are installing as a user, the framework should be automatically installed through the installer.

The Asys Installer requires [SharpZipLib](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/Default.aspx)
 
###Installing

 - As a developer, use `$git clone` or `$git fork` to copy Asys files to your workspace.  Visual Studio should open the .sln file.
 - As a user, simpily download the most recent installer from [the Releases page](http://www.github.com/criticaldiamonds/asys/releases), and run the installer.
